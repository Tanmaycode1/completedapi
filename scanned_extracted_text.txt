INTERVAL HISTORY:
Patient is a 78 years old elderly gentleman with past medical history of coronary artery disease, polymyalgia
rheumatica, expressive aphasia/right hemiparesis from previous CVA. Patient required hospitalization on
GE after a fall with a right intratrochanteric hip fracture. Patient was also found to have anemia and some
rectal bleed. Initially patient was seen by i on (J day prior to this hip surgery, and
advised colonoscopy down the road. Patient underwent short cephalomedullary implant, for right
intertrochanteric hip fracture. Patient was discharged on ae 6h Eliquis.
Subsequently patient was found to have bright red blood per rectum as well as coffee-ground loose stool.
Patient was readmitted on On (I EGD was normal. On J patient underwent
colonoscopy with which revealed rectosigmoid mass and the pathology came back as
adenocarcinoma, grade 1-2, p-MMR. Pre surgery CEA was 3.7.
CT abdomen pelvis with contrast, J revealed possible mass in the sigmoid colon. Hypodense lesion
in the right hepatic lobe measuring 1.2 cm. CT chest with contrast on J essentially negative. On
GE MRI of the abdomen with and without contrast revealed, there are several small lesions in the liver
favoring cyst. There is a hepatic lesion in segment 6 of the liver characteristic strongly favor focus of metastatic
deposit.
On patient underwent robotic assisted low anterior resection with robotic splenic flexure mobilization
by . Tumor was identified in the sigmoid colon above the peritoneum. Intraoperatively, the liver
lesion was not identified on the surface. Path number S21—7773, grade 2 colonic adenocarcinoma measuring
5.5 cm, tumor invades into the pericolonic soft tissue. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion identified. All
resection margins including radial, proximal and distal were not involved. 22 lymph nodes were removed and
one was positive for metastatic deposit. The tumor arising within the tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade
dysplasia., pT3 Nia MX G2 RO.
On patient underwent CT-guided core biopsy of the liver mass. Pathology came back metastatic
adenocarcinoma, morphology consistent with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.
Final stage,pT3 Nia M1 G2 RO.
Patient was subsequently transferred to nursing home on
Patient underwent PET CT scan on a @ PET scan revealed no significant FDG
avidity in the anastomotic site. The biopsy-proven metastatic to the hepatic segment 6 also lacks FDG avidity.
There is no regional or distant lymphadenopathy or solid organ or osseous metastasis.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Patient is an elderly gentleman with the multiple comorbidities and compromised performance status due to
previous CVA and recent right hip fracture. Patient has multiple issues.
1. pT3, pN1a, M1, G2, RO with CEA 3.7. Patient initially presented after a GI bleed while on Eliquis.
Colonoscopy with biopsy confirmed a mass in the rectosigmoid area. Metastatic work-up revealed liver lesion
and multiple bilateral hepatic cysts. Patient underwent low anterior resection on J Intraoperatively no
liver lesion was identified on the hepatic surface. It was staged as T3 N1aMX. Subsequently patient
underwent CT-guided biopsy of the suspicious liver lesion which confirmed metastatic deposit. Patient has
metastatic colorectal carcinoma with liver only disease.
Patient underwent PET CT scan on i @ EY =P ET scan revealed no significant FDG
avidity in the anastomotic site. The biopsy-proven metastatic to the hepatic segment 6 also lacks FDG avidity.
There is no regional or distant lymphadenopathy or solid organ or osseous metastasis.
NGS-CARIS, HER2 negative, MMR-p, PD-L1 negatve, NTRK1/2/3 Negative, BRAF fusion not detected.

Apparently there was not enough tissue to do the complete NGS panel.
Overall patient has low disease burden with isolated liver lesion only. PET scan was read out negative. Liver
lesion can be treated with liver directed therapy like radiofrequency ablation or microwave ablation. Given the
patient's compromised performance status with multiple comorbidities, we are not sure if liver resection would
be an ideal therapy.
Patient will clearly need systemic therapy. | believe we would recommend a systemic therapy then follow-up
with the liver directed therapy. Initial biopsy shows MMR proficient. NGS-CARIS, HER2 negative, MMR-p,
PD-L1 negatve, NTRK1/2/3 Negative, BRAF fusion not detected. Apparently there was not enough tissue to
do the complete NGS panel.
Recommending systemic chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX plus minus bevacizumab. In the meantime |
will try to get proper NGS panel on: Specimen. We should have plenty of tissue to run NGS panel.
Unfortunately liver biopsy did not have enough tissue to run the complete NGS panel. It may change the
treatment plan down the road. So far we are recommending initiation of systemic chemotherapy with modified
FOLFOX plus minus bevacizumab. Rationale, risk, benefit and side effects were reviewed. We are also
recommending Infuse-a-Port placement.
We will refer him back to J for the consideration of port placement.
Patient will come back to see me in couple of weeks.
2. Anemia. There is an evidence of iron deficiency. Folate is also low normal. May consider intravenous iron
infusion. Also initiate folic acid 1 mg daily.
3. Right intertrochanteric hip fracture status post short cephalomedullary implant, i Patient is
following orthopedics.
| had a very detailed and comprehensive discussion with the patient and family. Our discussion lasted more
than an hour today.
